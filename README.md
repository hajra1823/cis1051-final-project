For my final project, I wanted to make a food recommendation Android app. I was thinking of having two ways to go about suggesting a food place for a user:

1. User inputs their food place ideas, and a random choice is returned.
2. User answers questions about how much they are willing to pay, type of cuisine they are interested in, distance, etc. and based off of these answers, a choice is returned (still a bit random, but more curated). 

When making this app, I knew that I'd be able to create option 1 as it was using the random library we've leared in class. However, when looking into going about option 2, I was not sure if I'd be able to create an algorithm within the deadline of this project. It was still interesting to learn about however. 

My biggest obstacle for this program was learning KivyMD, which is a library in Python. I learned about classes and how to refer to functions from other classes by making variables global, but the syntax was a bit confusing. To get started, I used Python Simplified's YouTube KivyMD tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ah3JeHAfM0M&t=378s) and a Stackoverflow post on switching screens (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19491286/kivy-changing-screens-in-screen-manager-with-an-on-press-event).

My favorite part was designing the app - I was able to use fonts and images I downloaded into my computer into the app which was fun. 

Overall, I am glad I got what I ended up with because I've always wanted to greate a random food suggestion generator, and doing some mobile app design was a plus too.
