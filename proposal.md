# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Food Recommender


## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

This final project will be an app (or website) that allows a user to recieve food recommendations given either a truly random result, or one based off of user preferences. 


## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

If I were to run across a situation where my friend and I can't decide what to eat, I'd love to use something to help me generate a suggestion for me.

The first part should be relatively simple to do - the program will ask the user to list as many food places they have in mind until they are done (either click a button or enter 'DONE'). I am not sure how these entries would be stored (dictionary? .txt file?), but I'd also like the option to have these entries saved so that I don't have to retype them all if I open the app again.

The second part, I believe, requires more algorithmic programming. If a user chooses this option, they will need to list the cuisine, cost, distance, etc. (or, maybe the program will exract this data from online?). The app will then ask questions like:

"How much are you willing to spend today?"
"Fast food? Or finer dining?"
"How far are you willing to go?"

Then, using these responses, the program will generate one food spot for me. If I don't like what I see, I guess a 'Try Again' button could be added to redo.


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

NA

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

NA

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will be able to generate a truly random food suggestion based on a list of options.


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome will be creating a nicely designed app with interactive buttons. I might be able to figure out how previous entries can be saved and categorized as well (i.e., a folder of food options called Temple Food Trucks, Philly Favorites, etc.)
 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

If I am able to incorporate a curated food suggestion algorithm, so that whatever I input affects the result I get, this will be the best outcome for me.


## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next steps are to revisit the dictionaries and file opening lessons we learned and see which method is best for storing user input and returning values. For now, I believe I will be doing both - dictionaries to store each group of entries, and a csv file to store categorical variables for future use. I will most likely research how mobile apps store user info and work off of that as well. 

Next, I will figure out how to create an Android app (or embed this in a website). I prefer not to use HTML/CSS...just because I tried teaching myself once and it did not go super well! But, I could always try again if that seems like the best option.

Lastly, but  most importantly, I will be looking into how to get more 'biased' results based off of user input. I want to understand how to narrow down a set of entries so that there is a higher probability that a certain group of entries gets selected more than others. I believe I will have to look into statistics and probabilities for this.
