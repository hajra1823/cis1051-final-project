# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I want to create a food recommender that takes in a user's interested food places, and it will randomly (or via an algorithm) generate a place to go eat. 

I would most likely host it on my personal website or make an android app. 

The structure would be something like:
1. Enter your food spots in mind: (User enters as many as they want, then press a Submit button)
2. Prompt: Truly random or suggest based on certain things?
    a. If user selects truly random -> result is a random selection of list of food spots.
    b. If user selects suggest -> program prompts via questions like, "What cuisine are you interested in? How much are you willing to spend? -> result is a suggestion based on these answers.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

By myself :)

## Do you have any questions of your own?

1. How can I use user suggestions to narrow down the list of food choices?
2. How can I save a list of food places so that the user doesn't have to enter them each time? For example, if I enter all the food trucks at Temple, how can I save them so that when I open the program again, it's already stored? Can I edit these after they are stored?
3. Can I create buttons and more interactive elements in Python? Or should I try HTML?
4. I want to embed this program into my website. Can I do this using Python?
